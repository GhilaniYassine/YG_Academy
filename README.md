## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- virtualenv (recommended for isolated environment)
- Google Gemini API key (for AI features)

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GhilaniYassine/YG_Academy.git
cd YG_Academy

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
# AI Configuration
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Email Configuration (optional)
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password

# Django Secret Key
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

### Database Setup
```bash
# Run migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Start development server
python manage.py runserver
```

### AI Features Setup
1. **Get Google Gemini API Key**:
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create a new API key
   - Add it to your `.env` file

2. **Configure Media Settings**:
   - Ensure media directory exists for PDF uploads
   - Check file upload permissions

## üê≥ Docker (Containerized Run)

Build image:
```bash
docker build -t yg_academy:latest .
```

Run container (SQLite + static/media volumes):
```bash
docker run --rm \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  --env-file .env \
  -e DEBUG=False \
  -e SECRET_KEY=change_me_in_prod \
  -e ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1,localhost \
  -v "$(pwd)"/media:/app/media \
  -v "$(pwd)"/staticfiles:/app/staticfiles \
  yg_academy:latest
```

Open: http://localhost:8000

Notes:
- WhiteNoise serves collected static files from /app/staticfiles.

## Troubleshooting: collectstatic MissingFileError
If build/run fails with:
- `whitenoise.storage.MissingFileError: The file 'images/...' could not be found ...`
Then one of your CSS files references an image that isn‚Äôt present in static sources.

Fix options:
- Add the missing files under:
  - `learn/static/images/Untitled-1.jpg`
  - `learn/static/images/6.jpg`
  - `learn/static/images/logotn.png`
- Or temporarily remove/disable those `background-image: url(...)` lines in `css/index.css` (already done in this repo).
- After adding assets, you can restore the URLs and rerun `collectstatic`.
